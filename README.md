# note_Taker# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

Created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. Note_Taker uses express backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

* The application frontend was already created, it's was my job to build the backend and connect the two.

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

This application...

-Allow's users to create and save notes.

-Allow's users to view previously saved notes.

-Allow's users to delete previously saved notes.

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
